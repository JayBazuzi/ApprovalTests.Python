# Values

  We value having fun while
  Coding >> Mobbing >> Learning 
  
  * Code: We want to get something shipped 
  * Mobbing: This is a social event, group work, meet people, deal with conflicts/feelings, other human stuff
  * Learning: You are invited to join just to learn

  We strive to make this a safe environment
