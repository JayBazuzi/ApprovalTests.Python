# Values

  We value having fun while
  Coding >> Mobbing >> Learning 
  
  * Code: We want to get something shipped 
  * Mobbing: This is a social event, group work, meet people, deal with conflicts/feelings, other human stuff
  * Learning: You are invited to join just to learn

  We strive to make this a **safe environment**. In order to achieve this, we agree to these responsibilities:
  * As an individual, I am responsible for asking for what I need. 
  * As participants in an ensemble, we are responsible for making this a safe place to do so

# Agenda

  1. Choose item to work on (15 minutes or less)
  2. Do item (1-2 hours)
  3. Retrospective (As long as needed, has been taking 2-3 hours)

**You can leave at any time** - and people do.
