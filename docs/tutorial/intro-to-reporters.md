## What is a reporter
When approvaltests fails the mechanism to give you more information about that failing
is via a reporter. Most of the time this means opening a diff tool to show you 
the `.approved.` (expected) vs `.received.` (actual).  

The default reporter will search your machine for any installed diff tool.

## Customizing the reporters.json

You can add a difftool and path to ApprovalTests by editing the [`reporters.json`](../../approvaltests/reporters/reporters.json) file.
