## What did you Feel?

PK: Little confused at Iâ€™m first time doing this 
Confused as well, new to env, python
Excited to be here!
Hope to be here again to learn more!
Happy. Not confused about being confused :)
Want to come more prepared
Happy about the group!
Glad we have new people
THInk we could do an intro to Approvals
    Use a approvals to do a 10 min kata using approvals


## What did you Learn?

PK: testing and how to read the code. I need to learn how to read python code.
Collaboration - people come together, divergent opinions converge to same path (examples? specifics?)
Biggest learning - about this weekly meetup
Here - learn more - how to help the navigator
How to create a safe space, anyone can participate
As a facilitator: I can *ask questions* to help participants
Feel lost, drawing about the Namer was not clear enough
Good to see people! People showing up.
str.format - 1. allows to replace many things 2. prob works well with the map expander 3. it fails when a key is missing (is it a good thing?)
much better auto-complete with type-hints (e.g. `template: str`)  adding the word str
 def __init__(self, template: str):

I'm frozen 

Observation: Nitsan did (as a talker) - asked Teresa "how did you run the tests?", Teresa knew - helped the whole team learn that
Another thing: "I'm Nitsan, I'll be listening to your instructions."
Nitsan suggested str.format

I try to montiro how much feedback I give
 because I have a lot to say

Be a little more assertive and Say: lets try this
Nitsan:  I let it go because I was planning ot let us do WHATEVER way we ant than then I oculd offer a refactoring
