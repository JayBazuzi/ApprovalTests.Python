## TEAM
how do you keep people coming back

sentence
"you know, i'm having that mobbing session tomorrow.
i would really appreciate it if you could join"

that would be in a group setting...
    what diana is suggesting is what i would say it more in a 1-1 setting
    except i don't work with every team member 1-1

they might come early/late... 

question: is that fulfilling your needs?

what would be a minimum to amekt his feel great?
i would love... 3 people
come at the start... and stay
i would liek them to stay for the whole session
each session is 1.5 hrs
15 minutees review ticket
1 hr of coding
15 minutes retro

brainstorming
have you had people show up and stay the whole time?
do you do anything to celebrate them?
team channel
thanks... list all the people that showed up...
i thank them... this is what we did today... this is what we learned
...
show them what you did... to gain more interest

question:
does the management appreciates these sessions?
what do they get out of it?

answer:
he sees the work getting done... which was not getting done before

---
for the next mob programming... manager, can you give folks another encouragement?
there are many things a mgr can do to support that

diana:
could you make the progress transparent?
graph!
    showed the number of stale backlog items
    tickets were just static before
    historical ones
        snapshot in time
        these backlog items never changed
    ...
    10-9
    impact you're having on the stale ones
    maybe that would make them energized?

----
diana:
the most exciting... seeing that thing go down
    something that was static or growing
    ...
    national debt
        are you chipping away at the debt?

----
diana:
i did this...
ways to get people involved and stay involved
...
i want to know how to do it for myself too!
i'm building this women's coding community, in phoneix. in-person events, and online
thinking a lot about how to build that
i had someone at work... 
diana, i think you're so good at building community
data-science community
    if someone asked me to do it
    ...
    i'm relaly excited to talk about it

p2:  
discouraged with the community building
team lead tried to support by making hte weeking ensemble mandatory
now I don't know why people are showing up

best events:
running start, 
buy in a from a few people and they sort of co-lead it with me
we are under the gun for some deadlines

what is sustainable? 

first start the ensemble it is hard to keep it going

Llewellyn says: keep it REGULAR
friday for S's team it 

toatsmasters tip: 
bi-weekly meeting
better to do it weekly because it is a regular occurance

Daiana:
Question to susan: when you were gone on vacation...
anothe roption is to get someone else be the host

to make it sustainable...
responsibility is distributed
multiple people feel responsible for making it happen
...

get someone else to host...

"Gen is hosting... Steve can you attend so she is not alone next week?"

Susan:
I had to get a coujple new facilitiators
last two weeks i've been training these facilitators
...
passing over the facliator role...
and we're actually there... it's easier to pass it over to them...

Susan:
We use the dedicated typer role...
Everyone rotates the talker...
I always ask for a dedicated typer... Especially when its bigger than three.
Regardless of size actually.

Tools 
AWS app stream
spent 5 hrs a week and it only cost $10

------
decrease the cognitive load

--- situation:
contract up 
want to be strategic
is this getting steam/ momentum

What would add value to the team 
and 
what would be sustainable


D: P1: can you do something valuable for prod code ? 
Could you mob together on real prod code?
- sessions more for tech excellence
- felt that the team is looking more the prestine example of going through it

Jacqueline said
if you can get the manager's buy in then they can give you more backing

ex:
new tech manager was excited about the idea
so them we started doing it with real prodiction tickets

tech lead interested in code quality 
strong management style
sessions are related to upskilling and improve together

Susan did a lightning talk about 

Susan stgarted these as learning hours
learn to learn 
learn tech things we need every day
 AWS, terraform, designing architecture

uses a lego lending library 

that opened their ideas to the AI tools
learn something that related to work



## PATTERN
strong pairing:  talker typer pairing 
one person can model talker typer pairing

solo programming
I writin out my intention before implmeneting 
My workflow is:
- in an excel sheet / scratch file: todos, hierarchical, nested
- goals, intentions, etc.
- treating the notes as a pairing partner, separating intentions from actions
What is the next outcome
- next concrete action to try to make that outcome happen 
GTD
- getting things done - david allen

TDD london style vs Chicago style



english:
what will that look like?
how will that look like?   <-- not correct
how will that look?

## EMOTION
felt chaotic at the begining
   different rotation style, 
  rotate on idea vs roate on time



# different perpective
getting us organized and decide what to do
the chaos shows up while we are trying to get agreement. 

just expect chaos at the begining of a new feature

Feeling - Surprise
People did not immediately undersatnd our todo list
Diana - usually one of the lower people
Thought we had documented it so well.
We're gonna start the day and just knock it out
Matt thank you for suggesting the picture

From Llewelyn - Nistan's
You already understand what you're documenting
Trying to convey what you already understand, and using ONLY text, without any feedback from them
It's not a conversation from tehm, here's all the information
Is super challenging
Also, we didn't have tests for it
Now that this person undersatnds... they can no longer provide feedback on ramp-up

Susuan
Also the terminology that was used
Remove the "stale" files.  What makees it stale, anyways?
BUt once we talked about it... we WERE using, but no longer using

Should we write down the definition?

the drawing was very helpful, more words might not have helped
if you were given the drawning that might not be enough

to use things for training pupposes, I will recreate the reference material to 
confirm my understangin of the process
lucid tools <-- his team

visual object learner (from diana0)
it's from temple grandon, she has a book that describes, not HOW you learner... but what type
of learner you are.
matt, you may be a visual learner.
jacqueline can often quote from this.
visual learner... vs. visual object learner
they need a concrete example of something to fully understand it.




Uncomfortable
when diana and michael disagreed about where to do the sorting
appreciated: we aknowledged that we had a difference of opion 

Nitsan - when i work with others
FOr almost every tech decsion I do not fully aggree, I almost always have reservations
SOMETIMES i will confront immediately
I usually just go along, 
then i use my own turn to steer the team towards my thoughs
 those types of confilcts ARE ALL THE TIME
willingly/ happily i will go along

the main goal 
reality eventually
it iwll pass tests, it will delight the user

9-5 team dynamics
the main flow, is to move the needle forward


## TOOL
## TEAM
when llewellyn is not here, we seem to spend more time on organization tasks
possibly because Llewlellyn and a strong style for facilitating
often works well because we might have people with different experience levels

Woody:  strong style
llewellyn says:  "will you be my typer?" rather than...
Strong style means
the typer - talker dichotomy
 the person typing is not thinking
the typer is not thinking, ONLY follow what  the talker suggests
allows everyone to hear the thought then see the code
rather then the typer talking and talking

## SURPRISES


mini retro 1 
Matt:
- exciting to actually work in the code
- proposed mini-retro to reflect
Michael:
- Designer protocol > 1-2-3 vote
  - When timer goes off while someone was talking, we all vote with thumbs to extend the time or rotate the talker
  - Propose that the timer means "finish the thought & propose the next intent"
Diana:
- proposed 4min b/c of timing frustration proposed by Michael
- If we did mini-retros, then we can pick up on Michael's frustration more quickly
  - Nitsan > how do we interject with mini-retro when we have flow?
Susan
  - thought everything went well so far
  - i liked how we wrote down the steps to write the tests
  - then it was like... just follow these steps
  - i didn't have any iddues personally with the timer
  - that was it... i didn't observe anything else
  - on mike's side, he shared that there was latency
Nitsan:
- appreciate that the team carried the task forward
- very good communication with everyone - everyone was clear in their communication
- challenge > why do we feel the need to change the time
  - Michael - sometimes the clock was good but sometimes the clock was annoying when we need to finish a thought
    - The group adapted as needed
Agreement:
    - when the timer goes off
      - typer pauses the timer
      - the talker continues to end of thought
      - typer does summary
      - then we rotate
    - One person has hands on keyboard
