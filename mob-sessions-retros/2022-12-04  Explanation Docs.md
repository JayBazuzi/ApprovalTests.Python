==========

Goal: Improve the documentation that covers the theoretical explanation of how to use approvals.

Ideas: 
- Maybe we want the TDD cycle and the approvals cycle to be diagrammed. (approvals is a bit better than TDD)
- Maybe we want a better document structure so the doc flows better
- Remove pieces that aren't explanation type documentation
- Should have so
