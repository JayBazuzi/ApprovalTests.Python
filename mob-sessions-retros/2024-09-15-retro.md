How did that feel?
 - Rough. It felt like we were talking over eachother and there was a lack of flow.
   - We are still trying to understand the problem, and explored a new problem halfway through
   - Still in the "what will we work on" portion of the coding
 - Valued our ability to pause and address the thing that caused friction for us
   - Contrast to teams IRL who use "Let's be more careful" as a mitigation
What surprised you?
   - Discontinuity between weeks in people and technical direction
     - Possibly caused by different people showing up each week and lack of a continuation bias
     - New prior knowledge caught a bug, and didn't show up until the next week
     - Llewellyn used to be the common thread and has not shown up for a few weeks so continuous contextual knowledge isn't present.
   - Jay showed up this week :-). 
     - Figuring out where he wants to prioritize time and work.
   - Decided to improve our process rather than build the thing

What should we change next time?
 - Rotation mechanism. Something more official
 - Never launched mobtimer.
   - Startup checklist:
     - Run all the tests
     - Start the mobtimer
