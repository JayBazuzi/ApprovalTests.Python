diana: nitsan tried ping-pong, llewellyn shut up.
like how it's going, need intentions.

Teresa: thanks for making space for learning
feel like we are all a group

Nitsan: can be more in the red. not testing what we are doing?
chat would do this,

Susan: I got all the easy tas ks


Llewellyn:
- We're rotating too slow still; with practice it'll get faster
- Like: this style surfaces misunderstandings in the group that might be hidden in our usual way of rotating
- rotate on green was designed for git handoff, each commit is green
