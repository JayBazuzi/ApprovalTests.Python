==========

Goals:
- Fix the Graph in the explanation markdown
https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Python/blob/main/docs/explanation/approval_testing.md#developer-workflow
- Continue improving the doc

Idea: 
- Migrate to mermaid
- Do it on github
- Copy the mermaid from the Issue


# Microretro

## How did that feel?
- Felt good, was nice
- Got into the rythm
- Understood how it is going
- Really nice learning graphing
- Nice to have a first OSS commit
- Good to know what to do next
- Joining late felt like a left wheel at first
	- Realizing they are already setup, felt more confident
	- It's the safe place that made me feel more confident
- 3minutes sounded absurd in the beginning
	- but once it flowed it was nice
- tired at the beggining; and now at the end - not tired anymore
- fun having a friend on the mob
- fun working with visual stuff (immediate gratification)


## What worked well?
- Good cooperation from everybody
- How it flows
  - Wanting to accomplish something simple but complex
- Learning
  - Learn how to develop skills
  - Feeling safe instead of incompetent because everybody is trying to solve this "new" goal
	- It was new to everybody
  - We changed "I don't know" to: "I don't know YET"
- Onboarding
- Having it a safe place to grow 
- When we noticed there was a misunderstanding on the recap, we paused and took a minute to explain it.
	- Using the recap as a tool to align people
- 3 min rotations +1
- no pycharm, only github, but like a tdd cycle
	- small steps, constantly checking the outcome
