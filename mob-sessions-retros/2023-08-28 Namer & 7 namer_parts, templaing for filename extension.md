# Original Notes 

After 4.5 hours, we stopped programming and a had an informal discussion.

- Topic:  How to hold (then clear) list

Llewellyn Falco holds lots in his head.  Holds things in-session (vs not).  Keeps it in his brain.

Mob will clear out stack as we go.  Nitsan feels that this hurts your mental capacity.  The tool breaks at end-of-session when mental stack goes away.  He keeps it in his head for "now".

Jacqueline Bilston said
> When you don't finish something in a week, it hurts the mob.

It's good for the mob to have a completion.

This week we had consistent participants

Notes don't transfer "the mental stack" very well.


Nitsan keeps notes on a pad.  Comes back to it later.
80% of the time it's cleared by the time he reviews it later.

Nitsan - GTD (Getting Things Done).  Stuff accumulates that doesn't get used.

Llewellyn can hold


What is "2 minutes" (See: "Geting Things Done" (GTD)) in Llewellyn-time is _not_ 2
minutes in mob-time.

Two dimensions
- Holding the ideas
- Transfer of ideas
	- to mob
	- to code


- Q :: Why did 2 minute problem take so long?
- A :: We had a bad test?  There was problem in *_json() base.


When it's Nitsan's talk time.... he referrs to his notes to determine
next

- Llewellyn Q :: When something (that is important enough) does he
  raise it to the group?
- Nitsan A :: Most of notes get disregarded.  Two different purposes:
	1. Get mind clear
	2. ???


Nitsan mindset - relinquish control of mob.  Even if he does not
agree.


Can you do both:
- Move the code forward
- Move the mob mind forward


Michael R. Wolf observation
> No.  You cannot do both.


Nazee Hajebi got lost when Llewellyn/Nitsan took off on an expert
track.  Maybe it would be good to ask "What was the moral?" of this
track.  That would not distract the back/forth, but also allow for
group learning.

Differences in this mob
- Not cohesive group of people.  Missing a week is different from
  missing time in a 5x8=40 hour week
- Many participants do not program full-time


Part of programming is just programming.

Nazee thinks that this code is more dependent than what she does with
her work team.


When Nitsan Avni coached w/ Emily Bache, they created a daily status.
Likewise with Llewellyn Falco and Emily Bache.

"Made to Stick" - Highly recommended by Llewellyn Falco.  Marketing?
Talk.  Monty Python.  Ask about talks.  What is remembered?

## Prompt

Michael created this prompt (see: https://chat.openai.com/c/7fde0106-a56e-4f64-bd79-4572f002276d):

> I am working with a group on ApprovalTests.Python at https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Python
> 
> Yesterday, we had a group programming session.
> 
> I will provide notes from our retrospective.  Please generate a list of the issues we faced.  For each issue, try to find practices and values that support that issue.


## Response
  Issues Faced in the Mob Programming Session:

1. **Difficulty Holding and Clearing Mental Stack:**
	- Issue: Some members find it challenging to hold information in their heads during the session and clear the mental stack afterward.
	- Practice: Encourage individuals to jot down notes during the session to capture important points. This helps offload mental load and allows them to revisit the notes later.

2. **Loss of Mental Stack:**
	- Issue: The mental stack of ideas can be lost at the end of the session, leading to a loss of valuable insights.
	- Practice: Use tools or practices that facilitate the transfer of the mental stack to more permanent mediums. Notes, documentation, or summaries can help preserve important ideas.

3. **Impact of Unfinished Work:**
	- Issue: Incomplete tasks by the end of a session can negatively affect the mob's progress and productivity.
	- Value: Focus on completing tasks within a session to maintain a sense of accomplishment and to prevent tasks from lingering.

4. **Consistency of Participants:**
	- Issue: Having inconsistent participants in mob programming sessions can disrupt the flow and continuity.
	- Value: Promote regular participation from team members to ensure consistent progress and shared understanding.

5. **Transferring Ideas:**
	- Issue: The transfer of ideas from one individual's mind to the rest of the team can be challenging.
	- Practice: Encourage open communication and discussion to effectively share ideas within the mob. Use documentation or visual aids to facilitate knowledge transfer.

6. **Effective Use of Notes:**
	- Issue: There's a discrepancy in how notes are usedâ€”some find them useful, while others accumulate notes that go unused.
	- Practice: Emphasize the importance of revisiting and using notes. Consider adopting techniques from "Getting Things Done" (GTD) to manage and process notes effectively.

7. **Time Perception:**
	- Issue: Different individuals perceive time differently, which can affect the pacing of discussions and decisions.
	- Practice: Maintain awareness of time constraints and ensure discussions stay focused. Regularly check in on progress to prevent tasks from taking longer than expected.

8. **Balancing Individual Input and Group Progress:**
	- Issue: Balancing individual contributions and keeping the group's progress moving forward can be challenging.
	- Practice: Foster an environment where individuals contribute their ideas while also respecting the need to move the group forward collectively.

9. **Handling Expert Tracks:**
	- Issue: Some team members may get lost when discussions dive into expert-level details.
	- Practice: Encourage experts to periodically summarize key takeaways or "morals" from their discussions to ensure everyone's understanding without interrupting the flow.

10. **Differences in Team Dynamics:**
	- Issue: The mob consists of individuals with varying levels of programming experience and time availability.
	- Value: Recognize and accommodate the differences in team dynamics, ensuring that everyone's input is valued and understood.

11. **Programming vs. Other Activities:**
	- Issue: Some team members have programming as a full-time job, while others engage in it differently.
	- Value: Acknowledge the different roles and backgrounds within the team, allowing for diverse perspectives and approaches.

12. **Status Updates and Communication:**
	- Issue: Lack of regular status updates can lead to miscommunication and differing expectations.
	- Practice: Implement daily status updates or summaries to ensure everyone is on the same page and aware of progress.

13. **Effective Communication Techniques:**
	- Issue: Some ideas may not be effectively communicated or remembered.
	- Practice: Explore communication techniques like storytelling, analogies, or visual aids to make ideas more memorable and relatable.

14. **External Learning Resources:**
	- Issue: There's a need for external resources to enhance learning and understanding.
	- Practice: Encourage team members to share recommended resources like books ("Made to Stick"), talks, or films that can provide valuable insights.

By addressing these issues and incorporating the suggested practices and values, the mob programming sessions can become more effective, productive, and conducive to shared learning and collaboration.
