# explore the git history
git - p



# recap
at some point there was a leap, we did not know if the POC 
was working
we had code, we modified the code until we could test it
 then 
 we could test it

 we tested it and checked it in

 we are experiemting to figure out where that Transition is
 how large of a step

 YGNI

# bigger steps with GPT
TODO:
test recursive
test. include files into sandbox that are not approved files

# retro
typing at the top - D
Do the whole Feature, 
it is not that big

Describe the feature to GPT
can we use TDD?
use english in a test context, instead of 

When you write the test first you are directing Chat into a very narrow specification
I just want to make it work
then 
do the thing now that I see it work 
we could even delete the code and write some tests

it is an exploratory step

RIDDLE:
3 people/students
the master said 
I will paint a dot on forhead, 
either red or green
all students got red dots
they can see the other 2 students

raise your hand if you see at least 1 red dot
all raised hands
then a student 
raised hand

OLD
whomever: knows what color dot they have on their forhead
no one raided hand
1 person raised hand:mine is Re


# nitsan
appreciate every's patience
everyone was patient with the tooling
two envs we had to make the tooling work for us

collab was GREAT!
even though there was a lot of tooling friction 
we still has a good time and make some progress

NOTE:   I feel we are taking toooo small of steps
and that is uncharacteristic for me to say
I think if we leverage chat we can take larger stesp even if we are using TDD
most of coding felt like old school TDD
we can do larger chunks using GPT

slightly impatient about size of steps
pondering:  could we go for larger steps

Great suggestion regarding shared GitPod shared viewing.

Appreciate patience w/ each other RE tooling

Background - Nitsan is black/git ninja.  Adding red/green/color verbal clues could add a dimension to narration, getting extra view into thinking vs doing.  And... by listener asking for what they wanted, it got better.

m knew dont hit enter
N very fluent with Git so N can resolve a lot of Git issues
and N understand the CI 




# michael
it would be nice to take a bigger step
good you said you liked collab and was having fun
felt like a slog to me today
we had patients for each other

M though N was annoyed or focused, couldnt tell
felt like we were low in the water
rather than up in hte plane running fast as a boat

M to N. I noticed it when M wanted to split assignments from <delcartions>
ok lets wait to see 3 or 4 tests and then we can decide what to do

So I went along - N

Is this worth resolving now - M
