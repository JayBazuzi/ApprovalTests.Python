# mini retro

Nitsan
- Appreciated: working on the idea, having new person
- Curious: How it works end to end

Diana
- Observed: Bhargav is very good with Python, also - asked when did not understand.
- at the start - a discussion - Llewellyn suggested we skipped the discussion / descritpion / overview and go straight to testing
- going forward

Nazee
- took some time to figure out what to work on
- What is it that we're doing? a description
- Llewelyn added "current behavior": very helpful
- Prefer having a written description of the task at hand
- is copilot really helping us?

Susan
- Liked: breaking down - checking current impl and then the new thing we want to do
- Noticed: "what's the next intention?"
- Consider going forward: saying "This was my next intent"

Llewellyn
- Liked: the functionality is nice, differentiate between override and adding
- Noticed: adding the comments helped, and things became easier
- Think we could've switched to "ping pong" rotations at some point, maybe after completing the first comment

Bhargav
- Liked: incremental breakdown - easy to understand
- am new to approvaltests
- TIL: Copilot is so good! Life changing
- TIL: `str`
- suggest going forward: taper off with the intent
