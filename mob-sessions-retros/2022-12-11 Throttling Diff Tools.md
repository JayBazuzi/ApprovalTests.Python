Goal: Throttle Diff Tools

## Ideas: 
- Don't open additional diff tools if 5-8 are already open
- Should probably be done inside Generic Diff Reporter

## Todos for next Week:
- Improve the message shown when the reporter is throttling
- Test actual throttling
- How to option out to message

## How did that feel?
- Felt nice
- Enjoyed it, was intense, felt like being in a hurry +1
- Environmentally uncomfortable :)
- Happy we got something done
- not happy we did do a practical test.
- 

## What worked well?
- technical difficulties today - was able to communicate between ourselves, and finding a workaround to get back into the zoom
- Good interactions
- Maintaining the protocol even with the new people, worked suprisingly well
- English first - allowed us to get the work going

## Noticed
- idea -> after the 1st, do a manual test (sanity test)
- the way the mindmap expands invites collaboration
- didn't run all the tests
- many new people today
- A First - very interesting, took time to getting used to it 
- wasn't sure when to talk and when to be silent - what's the procedure
- Abnormally - we did not discuss a lot, rather - went to work quickly
- Don't use the '>' sign in programming!
